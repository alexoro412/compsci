# Screen Saver

In this exercise, you'll create a bouncing ball screensaver, like the kind you spent hours staring at, hoping it would hit the corner of the screen.

Right now, everything is in place, but the ball doesn't actually move, and it won't bounce off the top or bottom of the screen: it'll just keep going forever. It's up to you to fix it!

Check out the TODOs to get started.
