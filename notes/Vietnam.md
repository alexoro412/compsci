## Document E

Source: President Lyndon B. Johnson's message to congress, April 7 1965

We are still in Vietnam because we have a promise to keep, a promise to the southern vietnamese people (since 1954). Also to prove that we are willing to defend people throughout the globe. "To withdraw from one battlefield means only to prepare for the next"

We only want independence for south Vietnam, nothing for ourselves

We are increasing our attacks in Vietnam because we believe our purpose requires us to step up our game

We will not be defeated. Resources are no problem. and since we fight for principles and values, not territory or colonies, our patience is unending

Peace by Independent south Vietnam

## Document F

The struggle in Vietnam has enormous implications for the security of the United States and the free world. Soviet Union is also interested in spread of communism by peaceful revolutions

## Document H

Cartoon with Asia labelled, and a man carrying his gun over a muddy area

## Document I

Americans were brutal to the vietnamese wherever they occupied. Nothing actually happened in Vietnam that justified loss of american lives. Vietnamese simply wanted peace. America lost their sense of morality. Didn't care for the lives of the vietnamese. too much pride.

Continued to escalate because of:
  - *pride*
  - responsibility
  - communism
Local Civil war:
  - Vietnam is actually a small country -- no domino effect
  - The vietnamese simply wanted independence, so we shouldn't have interfered
Retreat:
  - Yes, simply pack up and leave, the Vietnamese wanted to settle it by themselves.
  - We might have to help clean up the mess we made in south vietnam
  - and pay reparations for the bombings, and agent Orange
  - Help rebuild vietname, but get the military out, accept the spread of communism of vietnam


## In-class Video
 - 2.5 million americans
 - Feeling of pride and "best of generation"
 - Spring 1964 less than 50% of americans had heard of Vietnam
 - The Red Scare, how much of it was legitimate and how much was propaganda?
 - Was the distance from U.S. to Vietnam too far?
 - Was the Viet Cong's army better than Americas? what about strategy?
 - North Vietnamese never got demoralized by the bombings, they just kept rebuilding
 - A single bomb in Saigon did more than all of rolling thunder in demoralizing the enemy side
 - Increased draft to 35000 per month
 - Still outnumbered
 - Ground Troops only ever in South Vietnam
 - Victory by body count, not territory
 - *Search and Destroy*

 - only one third of the army at the end of '66 were volunteers
 - Different world, the jungle
 - VietCong have a lot of spies and sympathizers to alert them of American movement

 - Napalm / Agent Orange -- Operation Ranch Hand
   - Deforestation / Herbicides

### Search and Destroy

 - Soldiers didn't give much detail in their letters home
 - North Vietnamese / NLF were always ready to move, always in fear of an attack
 - Minimal rations (20 kilos per month of rice) equal among leaders and soldiers
 - Viet Cong stricken with Malaria
 - Bombs absolutely destroyed the area, "as if a scythe had cut away everything"

 - Pro War vs. media over who was telling the truth
 - Many americans unhappy with how LBJ was handling the war
 - In response to Tet generals asked for 206000 more troops
 - Move for south vietnamese to carry more of the burden for the war
 - Johnson didn't do so well in presidential primaries
 - NLF could match whatever the US threw at them
 - Johnson decided to partially halt bombing, and try to engage in peace talks. this was seen as Johnson admitting that continued escalation failed
 - Peace talks failed
 - Johnson not running for president again
 - Peaceful protests turned sour in Chicago
 - Yippies - Youth International Party
 - Chicago police took of their badges and ruthlessly attacked protestors while shouting "kill kill kill!"
