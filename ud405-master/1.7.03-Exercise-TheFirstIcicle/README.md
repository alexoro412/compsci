# The First Icicle

In this exercise you'll set up and draw the first icicle. There are very detailed TODOs for this segment, as there's a lot of moving parts. Later on you'll be left more to your own devices.

We recommend completing the TODOs working through the files in the following order

1. Constants
2. Icicle
3. IciclesScreen
4. IciclesGame

Good luck!
