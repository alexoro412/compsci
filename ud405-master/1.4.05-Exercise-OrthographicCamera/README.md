# Orthographic Cameras

In this exercise, we're going to use an Orthographic camera to zoom in on a portion of a game world. We've got circle moving around in a figure eight, and we'll create and apply an Orthographic camera that perfectly contains the vertical range of motion of the circle, while maintaining the aspect ratio of the world. 

Check out the TODOs to get started!
