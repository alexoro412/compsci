# Add Stub Classes

We just used the LibGDX project setup utility to create a fresh project. Now let's start to create the classes we'll need for Icicles.

We need the following classes:

* IciclesGame: Subclass of Game
* IciclesScreen: Implements Screen
* DifficultyScreen: Implements Screen
* Player, Icicles, Icicle, and Constants: just plain old Java classes

TODO: Set up these stub classes!
