/**
 * TODO: Start here to learn more about ApplicationListener and ShapeRenderer
 *
 * In this demo we're exploring ApplicationListener and ShapeRenderer. ApplicationListener is the
 * entry point into your code. To get some insight into the lifecycle of this object, we've inserted
 * log messages in each of the six required methods.
 *
 * Logging is provided by the host application, and will appear in whatever output stream makes
 * sense for that application. For the desktop version, it'll be console output, for the Android
 * version, it'll go through the usual Android LogCat system.
 *
 * After browsing through this file, try running the game! You can run the desktop version by
 * opening up the terminal at the bottom of the window, and running:
 *
 * $ ./gradlew desktop:run
 *
 * There's a point on screen! And log messages showing the lifecycle of the ApplicationListener.
 *
 * Aside: Sorry for the abuse of Javadoc comments. Android Studio does a nice job hard wrapping
 * them.

     * momentary freeze, which players hate with a burning passion. LibGDX does two things to avoid
     * this. First, there are a number of places where we need to manage our own memory. Since we
     * created a ShapeRenderer, we also need to dispose of it, as shown below.
     *
     * The other way LibGDX avoids garbage collection hangs is by providing a ton of custom
     * collections that cleverly manage memory. We'll be using some of those soon.
