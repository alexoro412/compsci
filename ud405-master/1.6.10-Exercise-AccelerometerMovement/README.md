# Accelerometer Movement

In this exercise, we'll allow the user to move the ball simply by tilting their phone! 

We'll use the exiting ACCELERATION constant to determine how fast to move the ball. We've also introduced an ACCELEROMETER_SENSITIVITY constant to determine how much tilt is required to get the full acceleration. To determine the acceleration on the ball, divide the raw accelerometer reading by the acceleration due to gravity times the ACCELEROMETER_SENSITIVITY.

Check out the TODOs to get started.
