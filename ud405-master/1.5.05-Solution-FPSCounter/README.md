# FPS Counter

In this exercise, we'll get more practice drawing from a Screen, and this time we'll use the value of `delta` for something useful. If `delta` is the number of seconds between frames, than `1/delta` is the number of frames per second, or FPS. Let's create a screen that displays the current FPS.

There's a lot of tasks left up to you this time. You're not expected to be able to remember all the little details from memory. Check out previous exercises and demos (and the solution code) as needed.

Check out the TODOs to get started!
