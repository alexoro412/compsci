## What I already knew:
 - Basic HTML
 	 - simplest of tags in most cases
 - some CSS
   - Mostly messing around and googling until something worked
 - Some simple bootstrap, mostly working with copied and pasted components from the bootstrap website
 - A little javascript with some jquery
 - in terms of design principles, I was very fond of googles material design, and never really tried to make my own things

## What I learned
 - Better HTML
   - more meaningful tags: nav, article
	 - properly using spans instead of divs
   - Tables!
     - relative sizing without going insane
     - Show shop page
 - Better CSS
   - different selectors that can access certain elements
	 - css animations with keyframes
	 - transition -- ended up using these
	 - vw & vh units
	 - better practice with classes
	   - making a general shadow class instead of adding a shadow to every class that would have one
	 - responsive design and hiding items at different heights
 - Actual bootstrap
   - xs vs. sm vs. md vs. lg
 - using js and json for populating the page
   - show shop page again
   - sample code page as well
 - SCSS
   - Modifying bootflat theme
 - dealing with the client
   - color schemes... don't change them whenever they want
   - give them options
   - hosting on github really helped
 - design principles in general
   - verbs
   - rule of thirds

## Process
 - Most of my work at the beginning of the week, and then on the weekends
 - I tried to check in with my client at least once a week
 - barriers:
   - custom non-bootstrap elements with responsiveness
   - slow response on client content/feedback
   - client only seeing a color scheme he wanted to change and not looking at the actual content and such
   - working in raw html
   - sometimes having something just not work
 - most used sites:
   - stack overflow
   - w3schools
