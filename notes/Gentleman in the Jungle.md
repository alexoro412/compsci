# Gentleman In the Jungle

- The elephant asked for a bit of hospitatlity from the man, and ended up taking his entire hut

- Elephant's all like "your skin is harder than mine," but that's a lie

- Lion offers to give the man back his hut

- Animals create a commission of enquiry, but theres no one from the mans side on it

- Animals chosen by god to oversee less fortunate species

- Elephant makes a lie

- Animals didn't give the man a fair chance

- Space put to economic use -- Important

- Relocation

- Interfering in other countries will just enrage the locals to take action
