# Drawing Text

One more topic before we finish up with drawing, and that's text.

Text is actually a super complicated topic, so we're just going to do the minimum necessary to get some text on the screen. 

First thing, in LibGDX, text is made of bitmaps. That means that instead of describing the shape of the characters, we describe the actual pixels that make up the text. We'll discuss bitmaps and textures in much more detail later on, but the short version is that we just use a SpriteBatch instead of a ShapeRenderer, and everything else is almost identical.
 
To see it in action, check out the TODOs!
